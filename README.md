# Braille Wordle

A ReactJS website that introduces a Braille version of the popular game Wordle. The game is designed to help users learn and practice Braille characters in an engaging way.


No live demo at this time.

## Goal Features
- [ ] Interactive Braille Wordle game
  - Fun without prior knowledge of Braille
  - Is challenging yet fair; doesn't have a perfect strategy.
- [X] Responsive design for various devices
- [ ] Accessibility features for visually impaired users
- [ ] Score tracking and statistics
- [ ] Shareable results
- [ ] Contracted UEB braille mode??


## Notes
With just Uncontracted braille, it is really easy. We've found that starting with "Fuzzy" and "Stiff" gives all but 2 dots. 
Which is usually enough to answer in 3, at most 4. There might be a better combo too. So we probably need to implement Contracted UEB.

To add Contracted UEB, we need to allow more than just 5-letter words.
